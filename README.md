Project Problem #2: Lyfter
Lyfter is an app-based personal vehicle system (i.e., ride-hailing), and they approach your team for help 
in designing a system that allows them to efficiently match riders to drivers. 
They want your team to help them claim “the wait time is never more than 5 minutes”, and thus 
in determining how many drivers they should recruit if they anticipate 100 riders at any instant of time.
